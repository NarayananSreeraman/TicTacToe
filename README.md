![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-ED8B00?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)

A modernized, aesthetic version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built entirely in **Java Swing**

Unlike standard Swing applications, this project uses **custom component rendering** (Graphics2D) to create neon glow effects, smooth scaling animations, and a flat, dark-mode UI.


## ✨ Features

* **Neon Glow Visuals:** Custom-painted tiles that simulate a neon tube light effect using transparency layering.
* **Smooth Animations:** Symbols (X and O) scale up smoothly when placed using Swing Timers.
* **Dark Mode UI:** A clean, borderless dark gray aesthetic.
* **Score Dashboard:** Persistent score tracking for Player X and Player O.
* **Smart Resets:** * *Play Again:* Clears the board but keeps the score.
    * *Reset Scores:* Wipes the board and resets scores to 0-0.
